	<p>The OSGi compiler provides the ability to compile Java classes
		based on the resolved OSGi dependencies of the OSGi bundle. Compiling
		OSGi bundles is a challenge because each bundle has its own class path
		as specified in its manifest.</p>
	<p>Note that the OSGi compiler is only responsible for compiling a
		resolved OSGi source bundle. It should be used as part of a larger
		build process. Preparing, resolving and packaging the bundle are
		outside the scope of the compiler.</p>
